# Highest Profit Challenge

I completed the "highest-profit" challenge. The challenge was to load and clean a data.csv file and to print the number of observations before and after removing all the non-numeric data from the dataset's 'profit' column. The resulting dataframe was converted to a json file and the final assignment was to print the top 20 rows with the highest profit values.
